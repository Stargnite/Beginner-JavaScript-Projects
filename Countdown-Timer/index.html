				<p>God of War II is an action-adventure hack and slash
					video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published
					by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released for the
					PlayStation 2 (PS2) console on March 13, 2007, it is the second
					installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically,
					and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology 
					and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif.
					The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who
					killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods,
					who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld,
					he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate,
					as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal,
					and take revenge on Zeus.</p>
